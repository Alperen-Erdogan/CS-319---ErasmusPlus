ErasmusPlus will be an web application that will make registering for Erasmus and Exchange programs easier for both the students and coordinators.

There will be two types of users: Student and Coordinator.
We will try to eliminate the usage of mail or at least make it automated.
The forms needed to apply for the programs will be auto generated. User should be able to fill in the blanks to complete the form.
We will try to implement support for both Erasmus and Exchange.
Students will be able to see their application status after they turn it in. 
Coordinators will see a to do list that is distributed based on their workload. This might be as a small view on one corner of the screen that is always on.
Coordinators will receive in app notifications for new tasks since last log in.
Relevant information for the users will be logged and accessible.
We will try to implement some sort of course grouping feature for schools with courses that have very little credit.

The language for development and group workload will be decided later.
